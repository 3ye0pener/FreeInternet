## If you want to help, there are a few things you can do:
### By setting up and launching servers.
If you have the technical expertise, we encourage you to review the Readme files for each protocol and set up a server. If you are able to do so, we would be grateful if you could open a pull request to share your configuration with us.
### Share information
Inform your friends and family about our work, including how to connect to our services and how they can assist in our efforts.

Thank you for considering how you can support our efforts to stand up to censorship and oppression in Iran and provide access to information and freedom of expression to the country's citizens.
